# tictactoe

Tic tac toe is one of my first side projects away from college. Originally I didn't know where to start for side projects and I wanted to start off with something not too difficult so I decided to make tic tac toe since everyone knows how to play. From this project I got a little experience with JFrame.

## Features
I made this tic tac toe with a bunch of functionality so that if you'd like, you could add a computer player to play with you. One example that I made was a 'dumb' random player. This computer player will randomly select a free space on the tic tac toe board. In the future, I could add a 'smarter' computer player that could have strategy. 

## Take aways
I had fun creating this since it was my first time without direction from class. Need to use Java SE - 1.8 in order to access the JFrame. I would like to still explore different paths of computer science.
